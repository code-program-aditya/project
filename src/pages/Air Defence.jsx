                        <p className='t'>India’s advancement toward self-reliance in defense technology has gained renewed momentum with the launch of Project Kusha, an ambitious indigenous program aimed at delivering a state-of-the-art, long-range surface-to-air missile (LR-SAM) system. Developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Project Kusha is designed both to match and, in some technical aspects, surpass the imported systems currently employed by the Indian Air Force (IAF) and Indian Navy. Set against the geopolitical background of increasingly complex missile threats in South Asia, and the need for technological sovereignty in critical defense assets, Project Kusha stands as a transformative force within India’s strategic posture. This report provides an exhaustive evaluation of Project Kusha’s developmental trajectory, technical specifications, interceptor variants (M1, M2, M3), core component technologies, systems integration, and its role in the broader context of comparative international air defense systems, coupled with an integrated analysis of its strategic ripple effects and export potential.</p>

                        <p className='t'>Project BMD is India’s two-tiered indigenous Ballistic Missile Defence programme, spearheaded by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). It aims to provide nationwide protection against short- and medium-range ballistic missile threats by intercepting incoming warheads during both exo- and endo-atmospheric flight phases. Phase I is Exo-atmospheric interceptor (Prithvi Air Defence, PAD), Endo-atmospheric interceptor (Advanced Air Defence, AAD), Demonstrated capability against tar. Phase II is High-end exo-atmospheric interceptor (AD-1) for threats up to 5,000 km, Endo-atmospheric interceptor (AD-2) with enhanced hand-off and kill-vehicle maneuverability, Designed to defeat more advanced SRBMs, MRBMs, and future hypersonic glide vehicles
