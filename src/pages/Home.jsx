                        <p className='t'>Fighter aircraft (early on also pursuit aircraft)[a] are military aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat. In military conflict, the role of fighter aircraft is to establish air superiority of the battlespace. Domination of the airspace above a battlefield permits bombers and attack aircraft to engage in tactical and strategic bombing of enemy targets, and helps prevent the enemy from doing the same.The key performance features of a fighter include not only its firepower but also its high speed and maneuverability relative to the target aircraft. The success or failure of a combatant's efforts to gain air superiority hinges on several factors including the skill of its pilots, the tactical soundness of its doctrine for deploying its fighters, and the numbers and performance of those fighters.

                        Many modern fighter aircraft also have secondary capabilities such as ground attack and some types, such as fighter-bombers, are designed from the outset for dual roles. Other fighter designs are highly specialized while still filling the main air superiority role, and these include the interceptor and, historically, the heavy fighter and night fighter.</p>

                        <p className='t'>A military helicopter is a helicopter that is either specifically designed for or converted for usage by a military. A military helicopter's mission is a function of its design or conversion. The most common use of military helicopters is airlift, but transport helicopters can be modified or converted to perform other missions such as combat search and rescue (CSAR), medical evacuation (MEDEVAC), serving as an airborne command post, or even armed with weapons for close air support. Specialized military helicopters are intended to conduct specific missions. Examples of specialized military helicopters are attack helicopters, observation helicopters and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopters.</p>

                        <p className='t'>Vehicles used in drone warfare include unmanned combat aerial vehicles, uncrewed surface vessels,[1] unmanned ground vehicles,[2] unmanned underwater vehicles,[3] and space drones.[4] Drones are increasingly used in war.[5] Some drones are used by both civilians and military.[6] The difference between military robots and military drones is unclear as of 2025: some say that lethal autonomous weapons are robots whereas others describe “fully autonomous military drones”.[7] Artificial intelligence is not widely used in military drones as of 2025, but is being tested.[8] Whether military drones can drill underground is unknown as of 2025.[9] Drones may be commanded by a separate branch of the armed forces, such as Unmanned Systems Forces.</p>

                        <p className='t'>An air defence system is a coordinated set of mechanisms designed to protect against enemy air attacks. Its primary goal is to neutralize or significantly reduce the threat from aerial platforms like manned aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), drones, and missiles.</p>
